In the "streamline" branch.
What files are actually necessary and used?
Can any of these be eliminated or used by other plugins?

These LIBS folders are unique to weatherfax,

    libs/curl <--- Needed for Linux builds
    libs/glshim <--- Removed, not needed.
    libs/plugingl <---Removed same as pluginDC
    libs/wxcurl <--- Needed for download of DATA
    libs/zlib-1.2.3 <---Weather_routing uses zlib1.lib maybe this would help

Other folders and files

    src/libaudiofile <--- is for the audio portion, can it be moved to libs? MAYBE LATER
    include/GL <--- is this necessary?  COULD USE LIBS
    include/msvc/inttypes.h <--- is this necessary? can it be moved?  DONT KNOW
    include/ <--- many audio header files?   MOVE TO LIBS MAYBE LATER
    buildwin/portaudio_x86.dll   JUST LEAVE HERE
    buildwin/portaudio_x86.lib
    buildwin/PVW32Con.exe
    buildwin/zlib.lib (used in Weather_Routing )
