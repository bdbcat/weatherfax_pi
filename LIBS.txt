In the "streamline" branch.
What files are actually necessary and used?
Can any of these be eliminated or used by other plugins?

These LIBS folders are unique to weatherfax,

    libs/curl <--- Is this really needed?
    libs/glshim <--- I don't think this is needed anymore
    libs/plugingl <---I think this is the same as pluginDC
    libs/wxcurl <--- Is this needed?
    libs/zlib-1.2.3 <---Weather_routing needs zlib1.lib maybe this would help

Other folders and files

    src/libaudiofile <--- is for the audio portion, can it be moved to libs?
    include/GL <--- is this necessary?
    include/msvc/inttypes.h <--- is this necessary? can it be moved?
    include/ <--- many audio header files?
    buildwin/portaudio_x86.dll
    buildwin/portaudio_x86.lib
    buildwin/PVW32Con.exe
    buildwin/zlib.lib (used in Weather_Routing )
