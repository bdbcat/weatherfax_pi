WeatherFax Update Notes:

Operationsal Notes
=======================
To start out with a clean slate, no previous weatherfax xml files.
1. Remove the %localappdata%/opencpn/plugins/weatherfax/data files   Use Options > Plugins > Uninstall the plugin.
2. Remove the local user directory data, in particular coordinateSets.xml   Manually remove this directory  "C:\ProgramData\opencpn\plugins\weatherfax" or emtpy it.
3. Not necessary, but you can manually remove all weatherfax_pi tarballs from "C:\ProgramData\opencpn\plugins\cache\tarballs"
For more information about the location of installation files see the Development Manual - Installation Paths https://opencpn-manuals.github.io/main/plugin-installer/Installation-paths.html
4. Use search "CoordinateSets.xml" in your files to determine where the Opencpn local user (writable) files are stored if you don't know already.

When weatherfax_pi tarballs are installed, updated  %localappdata%/opencpn/plugins/weatherfax/data files are installed.
After internet weatherfax files are retrieved and when weatherfax or opencpn is closed, the coordinateSets.xml in memory is saved to the User writable directory "C:\ProgramData\opencpn\plugins\weatherfax" with any Image Wizard coordinate changes made by the User. This coordinateSets.xml file is used instead of the installation coordinateSets.xml file at %localappdata%/opencpn/plugins/weatherfax/data.

Maintenance of XML Files

The weatherfaxinternetretrieval.xml and weatherfaxschedules.xml files must be maintained and updated by all the USERS!

Update Notes
=====================
May 5/17/2022
Basically everything in this file have been reviewed and corrected or discarded.:

    Mauricius: Discarded
    Singapore: Discarded but awaiting for a reply from them hopefully
    Japan: Discarded
    South Africa: Updated
    French Polynesia: Updated
    Chile: Remapped (one Mercator changed to Fixed-Flat and one Conic to Polar)
    PWx, GFS, ECMWF and UKMO for a better coverage
    Europe: Updated


1. Mauritius – Files exist confirmed via browser on the web, accessible vie the homepage within browser.  Directly URL access not possilbe….Protection of some sort?

2. Singapore – This needs work. Several charts, wave height and swell, no longer work. Format must has changed. The surface wind charts work.

3. Japan - Unable to calibrate the charts, format is not polar or anything similar. Also VERY small, numbers hard to read,  left at the best compromise

4. South Africa - Internals of the website must have changed, not able to get any access to the charts.

5. French Polynesia – same thing as in SA.

6. Chile – Polar file is hard to calibrate almost impossible to get a perfect mapping.

7. We need better coverage for Asia, Malysia and Japan.

8. We have lost some sources for Europe and could use more coverage.
